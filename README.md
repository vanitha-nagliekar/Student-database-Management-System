## Student Database Management System
# Introduction
This SQL mini project focuses on building a Student Database Management System to gain practical experience in writing SQL queries. Through this project, you'll utilize various SQL clauses, nested queries, functions, and wildcards. Familiarity with basic SQL fundamentals is assumed.

# Project Scenario
The project involves working with a database consisting of two tables: Students and Courses. The Students table stores details of enrolled students, while the Courses table contains information about available courses.

# Database Schema
- Table: Students
Columns: student_id (Primary Key), student_name, date_of_birth, email, major
- Table: Courses
Columns: course_id (Primary Key), course_name, credit_hours, instructor
# Tasks
- Database Setup: Create the database schema with the provided tables and insert sample data into both tables.
# Query Tasks: Write SQL queries to retrieve the following information:
- List of all students.
- List of all courses.
- List of students majoring in a specific major (e.g., Computer Science).
- List of students born before a specific date.
- List of courses taught by a specific instructor.
- Total number of students enrolled in each major.
- Course with the highest number of credit hours.
- Oldest and youngest students in the database.
# Update Queries: Implement SQL queries to update the database:
- Add a new course to the Courses table.
- Enroll a new student in the Students table.
- Update the email address of a student based on their student_id.
# Nested Queries: Write SQL queries with nested queries to:
- Retrieve the list of students enrolled in a specific course.
- Retrieve the list of courses with enrollments greater than a certain number.
# Usage
- Database Setup: Create a new database and execute the SQL scripts provided in the project to set up the schema and insert sample data.
- Query Execution: Run the SQL queries provided in the project to perform various tasks and retrieve required information.
